# jobsearchCLI
a CLI for searching and saving links to job listings

Looking through job listings can sometimes be demotivating to say the least.
Why not just save a bunch of links to the job announcements, visit the ad directly and take it from there?

Me and my friends find it more convenient and stress reducing.

Download the geckdriver for Selenium from here:

Make sure itâ€™s in your PATH, e. g., place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin or directly
in the projects folder.

## Run it in a virtual environment Mac or Linux:
